# Partes_Input_Num_String

This pretends to be a first step to write a big numbers arithmetic program being the filtering of the input of strings to be valid numbers
avoiding more than one sign, or more than one decimal point or have zeroes before other digits at the left od the decimal point (only admit
one alone zero before the decimal point) also avoids the presence of any charater diferent than 0 to 9.   Well a first step as I said before
Thanks to any coments, supposedly can have huge improovements!
